# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Description of the “penguins” dataset

The “penguins” dataset consists of 8 variables, which are “species”,
“island”, “bill_length_mm”, “bill_depth_mm”, “flipper_length_mm”,
“body_mass_g”, “sex”, and “year”. The mean of “bill_length_mm” is 43.92
and the mean of “bill_depth_mm” is 17.15. The mean of
“flipper_length_mm” is 200.92 and the mean of “body_mass_g” is 4201.75.
Furthermore, the “penguins” dataset consists of 344 rows and 8 columns.

## Creating a scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

## Exporting scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

## Creating a dataframe

This is a dataframe called “problem_2\_df” that was created and it is
comprised of a random sample, logical vector, character vector, and
factor vector.

``` r
problem_2_df =
  tibble(
    random_sample = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    logical_vector = random_sample > 0,
    character_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    factor_vector = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high",       "low"))
  )

problem_2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    random_sample logical_vector character_vector factor_vector
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>          <chr>            <fct>        
    ##  1         0.799 TRUE           a                low          
    ##  2         0.343 TRUE           b                medium       
    ##  3         1.33  TRUE           c                high         
    ##  4         0.944 TRUE           d                low          
    ##  5        -0.659 FALSE          e                medium       
    ##  6         1.77  TRUE           f                high         
    ##  7         0.197 TRUE           g                low          
    ##  8        -0.664 FALSE          h                medium       
    ##  9         0.715 TRUE           i                high         
    ## 10        -0.206 FALSE          j                low

## Computing a mean of each variable in the dataframe

The mean of the “random_sample” variable is 0.4570791. The mean of the
“logical_vector” variable is 0.7. The mean of the “character_vector”
variable cannot be computed as it is not a numeric or logical variable.
The mean of the “character_vector” variable is computed as NA. The mean
of the “factor_vector” variable cannot be computed as it is not a
numeric or logical variable. The mean of the “factor_vector” variable is
computed as NA.

``` r
mean(pull(problem_2_df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.4570791

``` r
mean(pull(problem_2_df, logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(problem_2_df, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_2_df, character_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem_2_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_2_df, factor_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## Converting variables from one type to another

The following code changes the logical variable to a numeric variable.
The following code also changes the factor variable to a numeric
variable. However, the following code is not able to change the
character variable to a numeric variable, which explains why I cannot
compute the mean from the character variable. I can only compute means
from numeric and logical variables. I can compute a mean from a factor
variable if it is converted to a numeric variable. I cannot compute
means from character variables as this variable type cannot be converted
to a numeric variable.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem_2_df, logical_vector))

as.numeric(pull(problem_2_df, character_vector))

as.numeric(pull(problem_2_df, factor_vector))
```
